## Quick Armor Swap

A mod to quickly swap out armor. Just a tiny utility for quick combat games like SkyWars.

Configuring whether to drop or swap the equipped armor piece requires both YetAnotherConfigLib and Mod Menu.

You cannot (yet) save configuration between game sessions. This may come in a future update (not guaranteed).
